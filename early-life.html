    <h1>Early Life of Prabhas</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Prabhas was born on 23 October 1979 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, to film producer Uppalapati Surya Narayana Raju and Siva Kumari. He is the youngest of three children, with an elder brother, Prabodh, and an elder sister, Pragathi.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though Prabhas had no initial interest in acting, he later developed a passion for cinema and pursued a career in the film industry. He completed his schooling at DNR School in Bhimavaram and later attended Sri Chaitanya College in Hyderabad, where he studied engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Encouraged by his father and inspired by actors like Rajkumar and his uncle Krishnam Raju, Prabhas decided to enter the film industry. His debut came with the movie *Eeswar* (2002), marking the beginning of his journey as an actor.
